# Troubleshooting

If you get a notice from Heroku that says:

```
Your database postgresql-pointy-2352 standard-0 (GOLD on smallslive-metrics) must undergo maintenance.
```

Take heed! This means that within some time period the DB is going to be automatically updated and it will get a new IP address. You can adjust the maintenance period by running `heroku pg:maintenance:window GOLD "Tuesday 14:30"`

Once the migration is done, you'll get another email like this:

```
Maintenance on your database postgresql-pointy-2352 standard-0 (GOLD on smallslive-metrics) has been completed and your database is now back online.
```

Now you need to go into the `METRICS_DB_URL` in the smallslive app config vars, and change it to the new one:
First, go here and find the `DATABASE_URL` string (you have to click on the "Reveal config vars" button:
https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/smallslive-metrics/settings

Copy the `DATABASE_URL` string.

Then, go here and find the `METRICS_DB_URL` config var (again, you have to click the "Reveal config vars" button):
https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/smallslive/settings

Paste the previously copied `DATABASE_URL` string into the `METRICS_DB_URL` field and save the form.

Now the SmallsLIVE app should be pointing to the updated DB, and the site should be operating as normal.
