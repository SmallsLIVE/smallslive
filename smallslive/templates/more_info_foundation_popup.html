             The SmallsLIVE Foundation for Jazz Art & Education is a not-for-profit arts organization.  
             Our mission is to subsidize the operation of our venues, recording projects, tours and educational initiatives.  
             During this Covid-19 pandemic our mission is to keep the clubs floating until business can be restored.  
             We will also sponsor live-streamed concerts from the club that will keep the musicians working during this period.  
             We will also be offering emergency aid for Jazz musicians in need due to this calamity.
