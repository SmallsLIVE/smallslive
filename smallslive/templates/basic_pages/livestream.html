                    <p>Smalls Jazz Club was one of the first venues to utilize live-streaming and streamed their first show in September of 2007. Since then, Smalls and Mezzrow have live-streamed all of their shows and built aninternational audience of on-line fans and supporters. Our goal is to share the music created in our clubs with the world.</p>

                    <p>There is no charge to watch the live streams from Smalls and Mezzrow. You can watch all the shows each night HERE on our website. We also live-stream to our YouTubeChannels:
