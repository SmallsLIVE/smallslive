                    <p>In September of 2007, Smalls endeavored to document and preserve every show presented at Smalls and Mezzrow.  The result is the SmallsLIVE Audio/Video archive, a library of performances from the club which now numbers more than 25,000+ sets of music and represents over 4000 musicians.  This document is meant to be a historical record for the education and use of jazz fans for posterity.  The SmallsLIVE Foundation is a 501(3)c not-for-profit arts organization. The mission of the foundation is to sponsor and subsidize the upkeep of the SmallsLIVE Archive and the SmallsLIVE Live Stream.  Donations to the Foundation are used to cover bandwidth and cloud server costs as well as the maintenance of the website. All donations to the SmallsLIVE Foundation are tax-deductible. Access to the Archive is a $10/yearly donation, good for the entire tax-year. The live-stream is free from our site as well as on our Youtube channels (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@smallslive" target="_blank" class="accent-color">https://www.youtube.com/@smallslive</a>) and (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mezzrowjazzclub8350" target="_blank" class="accent-color">https://www.youtube.com/@mezzrowjazzclub8350</a>)</p>

                    <p>The SmallsLIVE Foundation also sponsors the SmallsLIVE Living Master’s Series. This is an honorarium award for jazz artists who are seniors and have been important contributors to the Smalls and Mezzrow communities in their careers. This includes a cash award for the grantee as well as a video/audio recording live from the clubs to archive and preserve the work of these important jazz artists. Winners of the award include Tyler Mitchell w. Marshall Allen, Kirk Lightsey, Sheila Jordan, David Liebman, Jesse Davis, George Coleman, Ken Peplowski, Jack Walrath and Roger Kellaway. These projects are available through the Cellar LIVE Music Group.</p>

                    <p>During the two-year period of the COVID shutdown, the SmallsLIVE Foundation became a critical component to the survival of the clubs. The Foundation’s “Get the Cats Working Again” initiative, raised money to pay bands to perform nightly from the shuttered club for our live-stream world audience. Thanks to the outpouring of good-will and on-line contributions Smalls and Mezzrow were able to pay the club expenses of rent, insurance and skeleton-staff and survive COVID. Today the clubs are open to vibrant and thriving audiences.</p>

                    <p>The entire SmallsLIVE Audio/Video archive as well as the musician database, membership information and to make a donation is accessed on our foundation website, <a href="www.smallslive.org" class="accent-color">www.smallslive.org</a>
