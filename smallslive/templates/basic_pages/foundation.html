                    <p class="text4">The SmallsLIVE Foundation is a 501(3)c not-for-profit arts organization. Our mission is to sponsor and subsidize the upkeep of the SmallsLIVE Archive and the SmallsLIVE Live Stream. Begun in 2007, The SmallsLIVE Archive is an ongoing archiving project with the goal of recording and preserving all the performances at Smalls Jazz Club and Mezzrow. The SmallsLIVE Live Stream is a free service of live- streamed broadcasts from both Smalls and Mezzrow of all concerts. Smalls and Mezzrow stream to our own website (<a href="mailto:www.smallslive.com" class="accent-color">www.smallslive.com</a> ) as well as our YouTube pages. Donations to the Foundation are used to cover bandwidth and cloud server costs as well as the maintenance of the website. All donations to the SmallsLIVE Foundation are tax-deductible. Access to the Archive is a $10/yearly donation, good for the entire tax-year. The live-stream is free and only requires signing up as a free member.</p>

                    <p class="text4">The SmallsLIVE Foundation also sponsors the SmallsLIVE Living Masters Series. This is an honorarium award for jazz artists who are seniors and have been important contributors to the Smalls and Mezzrow communities in their careers. This includes a cash award for the grantee as well as a video/audio recording live from the clubs to archive and preserve the work of these important jazz artists. Winners of the award include <strong>Tyler Mitchell w. Marshall Allen, Kirk Lightsey, Sheila Jordan, David Liebman, Jesse Davis, George Coleman, Ken Peplowski, Jack Walrath and Roger Kellaway.</strong> These projects are available through the Cellar LIVE Music Group.</p>

                    <p class="text4">During the two-year period of the COVID shutdown, the SmallsLIVE Foundation became a critical component to the survival of the clubs. The Foundation’s “Get the Cats Working Again” initiative, raised money to pay bands to perform nightly from the shuttered club for our live-stream world audience. Thanks to the outpouring of good-will and on-line contributions Smalls and Mezzrow were able to pay the club expenses of rent, insurance and skeleton-staff and survive COVID. Today the clubs are open to vibrant and thriving audiences.</p>
