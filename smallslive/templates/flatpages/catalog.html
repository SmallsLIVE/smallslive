      <p class="overview">
        The SmallsLIVE Catalog is a collection of individually produced artist projects.
        SmallsLIVE Members may sponsor artists of their choice and receive their music as downloads or CDs.
        Sponsorships directly support the artist.
      </p>
      <p tabindex="0">
        SmallsLIVE members can access these recordings by “sponsoring” the artist’s projects.
        These tax-deductible donations are directly paid to the musicians involved and are for the
        purpose of supporting the livelihood of the artists and to encourage their continued work.
        Sponsorships may be of any size and directed in anyway chosen by the Supporting Member.
        Supporting Members have a “library” from which the albums they sponsor can be listened to and downloaded as they wish.
        Unlike a traditional record company, our goal is not to sell this music but to inspire fans to support their
        favorite Jazz artists by becoming their direct patrons.
