      <p class="overview">
        It is the policy of <span class="smalls-color">Smalls Jazz Club</span> and <span class="mezzrow-color">Mezzrow</span>
        to live stream all of our shows to our website. Streaming begins at the start of the evening and goes until the close of the venues.
        There is no charge to watch these live streams. Please register as a member and confirm your email address to sign in and begin
        watching our live stream. Each show is available in our Archive generally one week after the performance.

        In September of 2007 Spike Wilner made the commitment to document every show at Smalls (and in 2014 with Mezzrow) in order to preserve
        what he felt were works of historic importance. Smalls Jazz Club was one of the very first clubs to stream shows live from their website.
        Smalls has developed a true international following thanks to the transmission of the shows nightly at no cost. The SmallsLIVE Audio/Video
        Archive is the collection of all the work done at Smalls and Mezzrow to date, over 17,000 recordings and nearly 4000 artists.
